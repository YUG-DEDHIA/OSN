## Shell Implementation

The given zip folder consists of all necessary files required to implement a dummy shell.

Every .h file has corressponding .c file consisting of implementaion of functions in .h file.

### Here are brief description about each .h file:

> - *headers.h:* It includes all the standard and made library functions, along with defined structs and global variables.  
> - *prompt.h:* It includes implementation of displayed prompt.  
> - *InputManage.h:* It includes basic implementation to manage input(space management, tokenizing with space etc.).  
> - *Inbuilt.h:* It includes implementation of cd, pwd, echo.  
> - *LS.h:* It includes implementation of ls.  
> - *System.h:* It includes implementation of system function, along with foreground and background functioning.  
> - *pinfo.h:* It includes pinfo implementation along with appropriate flags.  
> - *repeat.h:* It includes implementation of repeat function.  
> - *history.h:* It includes implementation of history function.(BONUS)    
> - *IO.h:* It includes implementation of I/O redirection.  
> - *pipe.h:* It includes implementation of pipes along with input redirection.   
> - *jobs.h:* It includes functions related to implementation of jobs function.    
> - *sig.h:* It includes functions related to implementation of sig function.  
> - *bg_fg.h:* It includes functions related to implementation of bg and fg function.    
> - *handlers.h* It includes signal handlers of Ctrl-c,Ctrl-z and child termination.  
> - *replay.h:* It includes functions related to implementation of replay function.(BONUS).  

In addtion to these .h files there is a markdown file which can be used to create an executable.
